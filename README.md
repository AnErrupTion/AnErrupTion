## Bonjour ğŸ¥–

I'm AnErrupTion/ShiningLea, and I like programming and coding! ğŸ˜„<br/>
I'm French but I can fluently speak English.<br/>
I can code in C#, Java, and a tiny bit of C and C++. I'm currently learning Zig to replace my main language (C#). âš¡<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what else to say... ğŸ¤” so just have a good day! ğŸ’¬

## Special thanks to JetBrains <3

I must thank dearly JetBrains for providing free licenses to their IDEs via their [open source program](https://jb.gg/OpenSourceSupport)! (This is entirely out of pure will, I really love their IDEs!)
