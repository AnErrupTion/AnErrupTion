## Bonjour 🥖

I'm AnErrupTion or ShiningLea, a coder and gamer in his free time 😄<br/>
I like to call myself "translingual", since I can talk 2 languages, French and English! (yes it's called being bilingual but shhhhhh)<br/>
I can code in Java and C# and I'm learning C ⚡! I also play on Minecraft and GTA V most of the time 👯<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what else to say... 🤔 so just have a good day! 💬
