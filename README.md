## Hi there! 👋

I'm AnErrupTion, your average software developer. I work with various programming languages, such as Zig, C# or Python. **I work on whatever I feel like working on at any given time.** I also end up being quite busy with school, personal activities. (I'm lazy as well, but don't tell anyone that! 😄)
