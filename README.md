## Bonjour ðŸ¥–

I'm AnErrupTion or ShiningLea, a coder and gamer in his free time ðŸ˜„
I like to call myself "translingual", since I can talk 2 languages, French and English! (yes it's called being bilingual but sheesh)
I can code in Java and C# and I'm learning C âš¡! I also play on Minecraft and GTA V most of the time ðŸ‘¯

I don't know what else to say... ðŸ¤” so just have a good day! ðŸ’¬

## Stats pour les intellos (comme moi) ðŸ˜„
