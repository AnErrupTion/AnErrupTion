## Bonjour 🥖

I'm AnErrupTion/ShiningLea, and I like programming and coding! 😄<br/>
I'm French but I can fluently speak English.<br/>
I can code in Zig and C#, and I'm learning Kotlin to phase out Java. ⚡<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what else to say... 🤔 so just have a good day! 💬

## Special thanks to JetBrains ♥️

I must thank dearly JetBrains for providing free licenses to their IDEs via their [open source program](https://jb.gg/OpenSourceSupport)! (This is entirely out of pure will, I really love their IDEs!)

## Stats pour les intellos (comme moi) 😄
